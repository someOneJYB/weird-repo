### 承接稀奇古怪的想法的仓库
- polyfill 的学习
- 一些 weird 的代码片段
- why use weird because something is beyond our cognition，we have thought weird for fear，but we have to accept and understand why，finally we must learn and master it！it is fun and overcome habits to understand which we think it is weird
- weird is not derogatory term in my mind
